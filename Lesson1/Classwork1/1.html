    distributor. With his parents' urging, DiCaprio explored his creative side, developing an early interest in acting.
    "I loved imitating people ... I loved joking around with my parents and creating different characters. I liked doing
    my own little homemade skits," DiCaprio told Backstage. But he didn't have much success in Hollywood until he
    reached his early teens.

<h2 id="El">Early life and acting background</h2>
<p>Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born on November 11, 1974, in Los Angeles, California, the only child of Irmelin
    (née Indenbirken), a legal secretary, and George DiCaprio, an underground comix writer, publisher, and distributor
    of comic books.[ His father is of Italian and German descent; DiCaprio is conversant in German. His maternal
    grandfather, Wilhelm Indenbirken, was German, and his maternal grandmother, Helene Indenbirken, was a
    Russian-born German citizen. In an interview in Russia, DiCaprio referred to himself as "half-Russian" and
    said that two of his late grandparents were Russian. His parents met while attending college and moved to Los
    Angeles after graduating. DiCaprio was raised Catholic.

    DiCaprio was named Leonardo because his mother, then pregnant with him, first felt him kick while she was looking at
    a Leonardo da Vinci painting in the Uffizi museum in Florence, Italy. His parents separated when he was one
    year old; they initially agreed to live next door to each other to not deprive DiCaprio of his father's presence in
    his life as he mostly lived with his mother. For a while though, DiCaprio lived with his father, stepmother
    and older stepbrother, Adam Farrar, with whom he was close growing up. DiCaprio and his mother later moved
    around to multiple Los Angeles neighborhoods, such as Echo Park and Los Feliz, while she worked several jobs. He
    went to the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies for four years and later Seeds Elementary School, before moving
    onto the John Marshall High School. DiCaprio has said he hated public school and often asked his mother to take
    him to auditions instead to improve their financial situation. He dropped out of high school following his third
    year, eventually earning his general equivalency diploma.

    DiCaprio has said his career choice as a child was to become a marine biologist or an actor but eventually favored
    the latter, as he was fond of impersonating characters and imitating people. When he was two, he went on stage
    at a performance festival and danced spontaneously; the cheerful response from the crowd started his interest in
    performing. When his stepbrother earned $50,000 for a television commercial, DiCaprio, fascinated with this,
    decided to become an actor. In 1979, DiCaprio was removed, at age five, from the set of the children's
    television series Romper Room for being disruptive. He began appearing in several commercials at age 14 for
    Matchbox cars by Mattel, which he considered his first role, and later for Kraft Foods, Bubble Yum, and
    Apple.In 1989 he played the role of Glen in two episodes of the television show The New Lassie.

    At the beginning of his career, DiCaprio had difficulty finding an agent and when he did find one, he suggested
    DiCaprio change his name to Lenny Williams to appeal to American audiences, which he declined to do. He
    remained jobless for a year and a half even after 100 auditions. Disillusioned at this, he initially decided to quit
    acting, but his father encouraged him to further explore his creative side, introducing him to underground art and
    art in general. Motivated by the need to financially support his mother, he began acting regularly on television
    by the early 1990s, starting with a role in the pilot of The Outsiders (1990) and one episode of the soap opera
    Santa Barbara (1990), in which he played the young Mason Capwell.[ DiCaprio got a break that year when he was
    cast in Parenthood, a series based on a successful comedy film of the same name. Before being cast in the role of
    Garry Buckman, a troubled teenager, he analyzed Joaquin Phoenix's performance in the original film. His work
    that year earned him two nominations at the 12th Youth in Film Awards—Best Young Actor in a Daytime Series for Santa
    Barbara and Best Young Actor Starring in a New Television Series for Parenthood. DiCaprio was also a celebrity
    contestant on the children's game show Fun House, on which he performed several stunts, including catching the fish
    inside a small pool using only his teeth.
