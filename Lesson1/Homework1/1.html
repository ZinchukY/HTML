<h2 id="Hm">Homer</h2>
<p>Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12) is the main protagonist and one of the five main characters of The Simpsons
    series (or show). He is the spouse of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight
    (said to be ~240 pounds), lazy, and often ignorant to the world around him. Although Homer has many flaws, he has
    shown to have great caring, love, and even bravery to those he cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't.
    He also serves as the main protagonist of the The Simpsons Movie. He is 39 years old.

    His favorite color is blue and he enjoys dancing, eating donuts, hugging, driving a sit-down arcade racer, playing
    the piano and horse riding. His favorite kiddie rides are "Stuart Little", "Barney Train" and "Ride the Champion
    Mechanical Horse".

    Homer works as a low-level safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7G, although he is
    often incompetent and negligent towards his duties. He spends a great deal of his time at Moe's Tavern with his
    friends Barney Gumble, Carl Carlson, Lenny Leonard, and Moe Szyslak. At home, he can often be found sitting on the
    couch mindlessly watching TV while snacking on food and drinking Duff. Homer is also the only son of Abraham Simpson
    II and Mona Simpson. When provoked, he often strangles Bart for pressuring him. Even though he mutually hates his
    wife's sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier, he played Selma's husband for her to adopt Ling and agreed to be the
    minister for Patty's intended homosexual marriage. As a result of this, Homer is her legal adoptive father.[22]

    Homer may just be a normal man, but he has had many great achievements and experiences in his life. He has won a
    Grammy, an Academy Award, a Pulitzer Prize, been to space and saved Springfield many times.

    Homer is named after Matt Groening's late father Homer Groening. In a series of interviews in 1990, Groening
    reportedly stated that he named the character after the Homer Simpson in The Day Of the Locust, a 1939 novel by
    Nathanael West according to Planet Simpson, but neither explanation is considered definitive.

<h2 id="Mr">Marge</h2>
<p>
    Marjorie Jacqueline "Marge" Simpson (born October 2nd) is the homemaker and was sometimes strict and
    a full-time crazy mom of the Simpson family. She is also one of the five main characters in The Simpsons TV series.
    She is also one of the She and her husband Homer have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Marge is the
    moralistic force in her family and often provides a grounding voice in the midst of her family's antics by trying to
    maintain order in the Simpson household. Aside from her duties at home, Marge has flirted briefly with a number of
    careers ranging from a police officer to an anti-violence activist. Marge is 36 years of age, meaning she was born
    in 1954.
    Early life
    Marge Bouvier was born on March 19 in Capital City to Clancy Bouvier, a photographer-turned-steward, and Jacqueline
    Bouvier. She is the youngest daughter of the Bouvier family. She has a pair of older sisters, the joyless twins,
    Patty, and Selma, both of whom passionately disapprove of Homer.

    Meeting Homer
    Marge attended Springfield High School and in her senior year, she met Homer Simpson. She was wary of Homer at first
    but agreed to have a study date with him, only to find out that Homer was only doing this to get her to go to prom
    with him. She ended up going with Artie Ziff. She regrets going with Artie because he tried to have sex with her
    afterward. Artie takes her home and she later picks up Homer, who she finds walking home, in her car. Marge tells
    him how much she regretted going to the prom with Artie instead of him, causing Homer to somewhat repair the strap
    of her dress with the corsage he got her. After that decision, her sisters showed their discontent towards him and
    ultimately thinks he was just wrong for her. However, Selma does show that she is willing to make a sincere attempt
    to like Homer for Marge's sake, causing him to have a higher opinion of her, whereas Patty has never attempted to
    try and is always on Marge's case to leave Homer, thus it is why she and Homer hate each other. (Marge actually met
    Homer when she was at Camp, but he didn't call himself Homer and she burnt her hair so that it was brown).

    Marge has always been rather innocent and has also been said to be rather awkward in certain scenarios, especially
    when she is drunk.

    An example of this is when Marge is taking place in a magic show as a contestant and at this time, she is rather
    drunk so she keeps blabbering about certain things. The magician, Diablo, finds this annoying and pulls out a ball
    gag and while Marge is blabbering shoves it into her mouth so her drunken talk becomes muffled sounds. This could
    also link to Marge's famous voice which throughout the Simpsons has been considered annoying.

    Marge continues to make muffled sounds from her gagged mouth while a sack is put over her head during the magic
    trick.

    Marriage
    After the two had been dating for several years, Marge became pregnant with Bart sometime in the summer, and Marge
    and Homer got married on September 29 in a small wedding chapel near the state line shortly before.
    Married life
    Marge is the mother Simpson family, who spends most of her time doing housework, caring for Maggie, being supportive
    of and indulging Lisa, and either disciplining or protecting Bart from Homer's wrath. Marge is the only member of
    the family who encourages church attendance. She also appears to have a significant athletic ability. She is
    bilingual, being fully fluent in French. Her marriage to Homer is also very strong. They once spurned to participate
    in a key party as soon as they realized what a key party was and promptly left, although Homer also took the key jar
    with them, most likely to find his car keys.
